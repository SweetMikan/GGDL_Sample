# GGDL (under development)
GGDL (Graph Grammar Definition Language) is an XML-based language to describe a graph grammar.
GGDL aims to be a unified description format for graph grammars.

This sample program generates URDF files of randomly constructed robots.
The construction rule for robots is based on Robogrammar [1].
The GGDL expression of Robogrammar is placed at `sample/robogrammar.gramar’.
